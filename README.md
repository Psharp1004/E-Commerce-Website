# E-Commerce-Website
CS4HC3 Project

Instructions

The homepage of our website is index.html. This is the page a customer would see on arrival to our website. It contains the navigation bar that contains features of the website which would be present on all pages.

Navigation to shop-list.html is done through the header by typing into the search bar and clicking the Go! button.

It can also be accomplished by selecting the Laptops category from the Computers dropdown within the header.

Selecting a category that is outside of the Laptops column will bring you to shop-list-g.html, which is the same as shop-list.html except for having a different sidebar and having only placeholder products in the search results. This is the generic search page that the user would go to for things other than laptops.

Selecting a product image will bring you to its product page, for the placeholder products this is product-details-g.html and for the real product it is product-details.html.

Hovering over a product will bring up several clickable icons that add the item to the cart, gives more information about an item, and adds the product to the wishlist. Clicking more info brings up an overlay with additional information and a way to access the product page.
